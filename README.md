![Design preview for the Fylo data storage component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution of the challenge on Frontend Mentor. 

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.


## The challenge

I recreate the meter component. I try to make buttons more accessible. It would be perfrect If you give me some feedback.

How can I improve my Sass or accessibility?

See my [profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/sirriah) on Frontend Mentor.

Happy coding.
